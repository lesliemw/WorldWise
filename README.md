This app was created using a combination of React, APIs, and JSON.

You are greeted with a homepage where you can view "pricing" and "product" details.

The goal of the app is to keep track of where the user has visited, therefore the homepage will also prompt you to login to get a list of those places.

Once the user has logged in, a map API (brought to you by OpenStreetmap) shows a map with pins dotted around indicating where a user has travelled to.
